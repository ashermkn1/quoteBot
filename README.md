# Quote Bot

Quote Bot is a discord bot written in python that stores a database of user's quotes for a given server. In addition,
Quote Bot stores aliases for users using the [shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html) module.

This is my first discord bot, a little thing created for the server I am in with my friends. The quotes are stored in a 
SQLite database, storing the user who said it, the quote itself, and when it was said.
